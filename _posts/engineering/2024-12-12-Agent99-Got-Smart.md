# Agent99 Got Smarter

This is the first of a series of articles about the new Ruby gem [**agent99**](https://rubygems.org/gems/agent99) which provides a framework for the execution and management of software agents.  You may skip ahead and go [directly to the software.](https://github.com/MadBomber/agent99)

## Background

I wrote my first computer program in the fall of 1970.  I've been development software systems ever since.  That means I'm old.  Sometimes I say things that other developers do not understand.  For example Agent 99 is smarter that Agent 86.

One of my favorite spy shows of the mid-1960s is **Get Smart** which I think is an appropriate title for today's interest in bringing artificial intelligence (AI) into just about every software project which is not necessarily a good idea.

Before I go on about my new software agents library - **[Agent99 Framework](https://github.com/MadBomber/agent99)** - I have to provide a little entertainment history about the show which inspired the name of my new library.

Here are a few clips that should give you a favor of what a serious spy agency was like in the 1960s.
   - [Season 3 Title Sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ObCoCm61s) lists the writers as Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, two very serious spy guys.
   - ["Missed it by that much"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPwrodxghrw) is an iconic saying of agent 86, Maxwell Smart, when things don't go exactly as planned.  Checkout the example software agent [maxwell_agent86.rb](https://github.com/MadBomber/agent99/blob/main/examples/maxwell_agent86.rb) which half the time returns something unexpected.
   - [1960s Agent Security, Authentication and Authorization Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6UQW64hxMI) we should avoid!  Both of the AMQP and NATS messaging systems have great security.
   - [Agent 99 uses her skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW3WWotSW54) to get the resources she needs to complete the mission.
   - ["I'd like to work for IBM"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odDO4cGh2RQ) is what every smart robot like agent Hymei would say.

Agent 99, portrayed by Barbara Feldon, is a highly skilled and intelligent secret agent. With her quick thinking and resourcefulness, she frequently saves the day. Despite operating in a male-dominated environment, Agent 99 is portrayed as a competent and independent character, showcasing her bravery and capabilities. Her charm, wit, and no-nonsense attitude make her a memorable and iconic figure in the world of spy television.

**Ruby**, like agent 99, working in this Python dominated world of AI ...

- **offers a refreshing alternative** for developers seeking to build elegant and expressive AI applications.
- **encourages innovation** and paradigm shifts, challenging the status quo established by Python in AI development.
- **finds its niche** by appealing to developers who prioritize readability and maintainability in their code.
- **fosters unique projects** that leverage its metaprogramming capabilities, paving the way for creative solutions in AI.
- **competes by pushing for more integration** of Ruby-based frameworks, making them viable options in the AI landscape.
- **highlights the strengths of its object-oriented programming** style, leading to more modular and testable AI code.
- **inspires a community of passionate developers** who prefer its syntax and features over the more popular Python.

Now lets talk about the basic concepts behind the [Agent99 Framework](https://github.com/MadBomber/agent99) as implemented in a Ruby gem.

```ruby
gem install agent99
```

## Understanding Software Agents and the Single Responsibility Principle

Software agents and the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) are increasingly important concepts in modern software development. Software agents help break down complex systems into manageable, autonomous components, while SRP promotes the creation of maintainable, testable, and adaptable systems. Understanding and implementing these concepts can improve code quality and encourage innovation and agility in development teams. Embracing agents and SRP is beneficial for building scalable and efficient software solutions, particularly in areas like AI, automation, and microservices.

## What are Software Agents?

Software agents are autonomous entities designed to perform specific tasks on behalf of users or other systems. They are characterized by:

1. **Autonomy**: Agents operate independently without constant human intervention, making decisions based on their programming and environmental stimuli.
2. **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Each agent is designed to achieve specific objectives, often interacting with other agents or systems to accomplish its goals.
3. **Communication**: Agents communicate with one another to share information, send requests, or coordinate actions in a distributed system.

In the context of the client-server paradign, agents can be servers, clients or both (hybrid) systems where servers wait for requests, act on those requests and send responses.  Clients send requests, wait for responses and then act on those responses.  Hybrids of course do whatever they want to do when they want to do it.

### Examples of Software Agents

- **Chatbots**: Automate customer support by responding to user queries, performing tasks like booking appointments or providing information.
- **Web Crawlers**: Explore the internet to index web pages for search engines.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Analyze user behavior and preferences to suggest products or content.

## The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The Single Responsibility Principle is one of the key principles of object-oriented design encapsulated in the SOLID principles. It states that a class or module should have only one reason to change, implying that it should have only one job or responsibility.

### Importance of SRP

1. **Maintainability**: Classes with a single responsibility are easier to read, understand, and modify, leading to more maintainable code.
2. **Testability**: By isolating the responsibilities, each class can be tested independently, simplifying unit testing.
3. **Flexibility**: Changing one responsibility has minimal impact on other parts of the code, minimizing the risk of introducing bugs.

### Application of SRP in Software Development

When implementing SRP, consider the following:

- **Identify Responsibilities**: Break down functionalities into discrete responsibilities. Each class or module should focus on a specific task.
- **Modular Design**: Design your system with loosely coupled components to enhance separation of concerns. This makes it easier to swap out or modify components.
- **Use Design Patterns**: Design patterns like the Observer, Strategy, and Factory can help adhere to SRP by promoting clear interfaces and responsibilities.

## The Intersection of Agents and SRP

The concept of software agents naturally aligns with the Single Responsibility Principle. Each agent can be designed as a separate class or module that encapsulates a specific functionality. For example:

- An **Agent** for processing customer orders may focus solely on order management, while another **Agent** can handle payment processing.
- A **Notification Agent** can be responsible for sending alerts or messages to users, ensuring separation from the business logic involved in order processing.

Designing agents with SRP in mind facilitates better modularity and reusability. It allows developers to make changes to one agent without affecting others, ultimately leading to a more robust architecture.
