**Powerful New Features for Enhanced AI-Powered Prompt Management**

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/aia.png" alt="May I take your prompt?">

The AI Assistant (AIA) CLI tool has evolved significantly since version 0.8.6, introducing powerful new capabilities that make it even more versatile for dynamic prompt management and AI interaction. Here's a comprehensive look at the major features and improvements that have been added.

*The complete changelog and detailed documentation are available in the [AIA repository](https://github.com/MadBomber/aia) and [wiki](https://github.com/MadBomber/aia/wiki).*


## 🛠️ Enhanced Tool Integration

### RubyLLM::Tool Support
AIA now provides comprehensive support for function calling through RubyLLM tools, enabling extended AI capabilities:

```bash
# Load tools from directory
aia --tools ~/my-tools/ --chat

# Load specific tool files
aia --tools weather.rb,calculator.rb --chat

# Filter tools with granular control
aia --tools ~/tools/ --allowed_tools weather,calc
aia --tools ~/tools/ --rejected_tools deprecated
```

### Shared Tools Integration
The new `shared_tools` gem integration provides a curated collection of ready-to-use functions:

```bash
# Access shared tools automatically
aia --require shared_tools/ruby_llm --chat

# Use specific shared tools
aia --require shared_tools/ruby_llm/edit_file --chat

# Combine with your own custom tools
aia --require shared_tools/ruby_llm --tools ~/my-tools/ --chat
```

### New Tool Discovery Commands
- Added `//tools` directive to show available tools and their descriptions
- Enhanced tool management with better filtering and selection capabilities

## 🔍 Model Management & Discovery

### Available Models Command
A new `--available_models` CLI option provides easy access to all supported AI models:

```bash
aia --available_models
```

This feature helps users discover and switch between different AI models based on their specific needs.

### Model Database Refresh
Introduced automatic model database refresh functionality:
- Configurable refresh intervals (default: 7 days)
- `--refresh` option to set refresh frequency
- Config file now tracks `last_refresh` for better state management

## 📄 Executable Prompts Revolution

### Enhanced Executable Prompt Support
The new `--exec` flag transforms how you create executable prompts:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env aia run --no-out_file --exec
# Get current storm activity for the east and south coast

Summarize the tropical storm outlook for the Atlantic region.

```

### STDIN/STDOUT Integration
- Fixed piped content handling through STDIN
- Improved `--no-out_file` functionality for better CLI integration
- Executable prompts now work seamlessly with Unix pipes and command chaining

## 🌐 Web Content Integration

### Dynamic Web Content Inclusion
Enhanced web integration capabilities through the `pure.md` service:

```bash
# Include web pages directly in prompts
//include https://example.com/documentation
//webpage https://example.com/news-article
```

This feature enables real-time web content integration into your AI prompts.
