Here's a brief overview of the key services provide by life.church at no charge in order to share the Gospel and help Churches lead more people to become fully devoted followers of Christ.

#### Open Network

Go To -=> https://open.life.church

Many free resources such as artwork, graphics, music (MP3s, lyrics, sheet music), templates, slides, banners, sermon series, and training for churches available for free download.

#### The YouVersion Bible

Go To -=> https://bible.com

An online and offline Bible App for mobile phones which includes 2,400 Bible versions in 1,600 languages.  You can listen to audio Bibles, create prayers, study with friends, and much more including reading plans, a daily verse of the day, community sharing, and the ability so share your church and find local churches and events listed on YouVersion Events and YouVersion for Churches.

#### YouVersion Events

Go To -=> https://events.bible.com

Churches can build out events such as their weekly service to be found in the YouVersion Bible as well as provide attendees with an electronic bulletin.

#### YouVersion for Churches

Go To -=> https://youversion.church

Churches can publish their church so that people in the YouVersion Bible can join the church's posts and reading plans.  A church then has some great insights into the overall YouVersion Bible reading of the people in their church, yet it still remains anonymous.

#### The Church Online Platform

Go To -=> https://online.church

Provides a great way for churches to have an online service and actively engage attenders to help them feel like they are in the service.  It includes the service video, live chat, live prayer, sermon notes, Bible, and a service schedule.  Services can be either live or simulated live.  You can join one of our 70 simulated live services a week at https://live.life.church/   The platform we use is the very same platform we provide to churches at no charge.

#### Church Metrics

Go To -=> https://churchmetrics.com

A service to see trends and make better decisions to grow your church as you track attendance, salvations, giving, and volunteers.
