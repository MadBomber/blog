To Blog or Not to Blog?  That is a question! (especially if you do not know that "blog" is just a slang term for an online article.)

In today's digital age, establishing an online presence is essential for churches to engage their congregation and local community. One effective way to achieve this is through free blogging accounts on popular platforms.

Remember, the main goal of the church blog is to build a sense of community, provide spiritual nourishment, and encourage engagement among church members. By covering a diverse range of topics, the church leadership can foster growth and faithfulness within the congregation while reaching out to a wider online audience.

**_Free_** blogging accounts on platforms like Blogger, Medium, and Tumblr present various opportunities to engage the church's congregation and local community. By leveraging these platforms effectively and utilizing social media integrations, the small church can share valuable content, inspire others, and foster a sense of community online. While each free account has its limitations, they still provide a solid foundation for initiating an online blog presence for the church.

## Blogger

Blogger, owned by Google, is a popular free blogging platform. Leveraging a Blogger account can offer the following advantages for the church's online blog:

**Sharing on Social Media:** Add social media widgets to the blog layout, allowing readers to easily share posts on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

**Limitations:** Blogger's limitations include a limited selection of themes and customization options, restricted control over layout and design, and a lack of advanced analytics and features compared to other platforms.

## Medium

Medium is a platform known for its user-friendly interface and content discovery features. Utilizing a Medium account can provide the following engagement opportunities for the church's blog:

**Sharing on Social Media:** Medium has built-in social sharing buttons, allowing readers to easily share articles on various platforms including Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.  You can also share a teaser or excerpt of the Medium blog post on social media accounts to let people know the new article on Medium.

**Limitations:** Medium's limitations include lack of complete control over the blog's design and layout, limited customization options, and the inability to monetize the blog directly.

## Tumblr

Tumblr, a microblogging platform, combines traditional blogging elements with social networking features. By utilizing a **_free_** Tumblr account, the church can engage the congregation and local community.

**Sharing on Social Media:** Enable social sharing buttons on the Tumblr blog layout to allow readers to easily share posts on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Create quote cards and image-based content: Design visually appealing images with meaningful quotes or Bible verses from the Tumblr blog posts. These can be shared on social media platforms as image posts rather than just blog links.

**Limitations:** Tumblr's limitations include fewer customization options compared to other platforms, a predominantly younger user base, and the presence of unrelated content on the platform.

## Topics to Blog about

Here are a few topics in that could be covered in a church blog:

1. **Weekly Sermon Reflections**: Provide a summary and reflection on the main points of each week's sermon, allowing members to dive deeper into the message and apply it to their lives.

2. **Biblical Teachings**: Share theological insights and teachings from the Bible, exploring different topics such as prayer, faith, forgiveness, and love. Offer practical guidance on how to incorporate these teachings into daily life.

3. **Testimonies and Personal Stories**: Feature personal testimonies from church members, sharing how their faith has impacted their lives or how they overcame challenges through their relationship with God. These stories can inspire and uplift the congregation.

4. **Community Engagement**: Highlight the various ways the church is involved in the local community, such as volunteer activities, charity events, or partnership programs. This helps foster a sense of community and encourages church members to actively participate and make a difference.

5. **Church Events and Announcements**: Use the blog platform to share upcoming events, workshops, retreats, or special services. Provide details, purpose, and expectations for each event, encouraging attendance and participation from the congregation.

6. **Devotional and Inspirational Content**: Offer short devotional readings, inspirational quotes, or uplifting scripture verses to provide spiritual nourishment and encouragement to readers on a daily or weekly basis.

7. **Challenges and Spiritual Growth**: Address common challenges faced by Christians in today's world, such as doubts, struggles, or maintaining faith in challenging times. Provide guidance on how to overcome these challenges and grow stronger in faith.

8. **Prayer Requests and Intercession**: Invite readers to share their prayer requests, then specifically dedicate a blog post to praying for these needs. Encourage the community to uplift each other in prayer and offer support during difficult times.

9. **Sharing Resources**: Recommend helpful books, podcasts, sermons, or online resources that can assist church members in deepening their understanding of the Bible, broadening their theological knowledge, or growing in their faith.

10. **Seasonal Reflections**: During special times of the liturgical year (such as Advent, Lent, or Easter), provide reflections and insights into the significance and meaning of these seasons. Offer guidance on how to spiritually prepare and observe these seasons of the Christian calendar.
