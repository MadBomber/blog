Some of the feasts and festivals observed by both the Hebrews and Christians are:

1. Passover - This commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt and is celebrated by both Jews and Christians. It typically occurs in late March or early April.

2. Pentecost - Also known as the Feast of Weeks, it commemorates the giving of the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai. Christians observe Pentecost to remember the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles. It occurs 50 days after Passover, which usually falls in May or June.

3. Tabernacles (Sukkot) - This feast commemorates the time when the Israelites lived in temporary shelters during their journey in the wilderness. Christians do not universally observe this feast, but some do as a way to remember God's provision and protection. It usually occurs in September or October.

4. Feast of Trumpets (Rosh Hashanah) - This marks the beginning of the Jewish High Holy Days and is celebrated as the Jewish New Year. For Christians, this day holds significance in relation to the end times and the return of Jesus. It typically falls in September.

5. Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) - Considered the most sacred day in Judaism, it is a time of repentance and fasting. Some Christians observe this day as a time of reflection and seeking God's forgiveness. Yom Kippur usually occurs in September or October.

6. Feast of Unleavened Bread - This is closely tied to the Passover and is commemorated both by Jews and some Christian denominations. It typically occurs at the same time as Passover, in late March or early April.
